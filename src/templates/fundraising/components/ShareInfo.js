          The shareholders are the ones contributing to the fundraising
          campaign. They are represented through a custom bonded-token and a
          voting app. They hold most of the governance rights over the
          organization.

          This architecture grants most of the governance rights to
          shareholders, to protect their investment. However, this also requires
          the organization to be able to mitigate situations where a shareholder
          could own the whole organization by owning more than 50% of the
          shares.

          css={`

          This is why shareholder votes, where most of the organizationâ€™s
          decisions are made, can only be opened and initiated by the board.
